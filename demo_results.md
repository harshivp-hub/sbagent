# Demo Results Summary

This document summarizes the optimization recommendations generated by the LLM agent for three core test scenarios.

---

## 1. Over-Provisioned Scenario

- **Total Savings**: **$1210.00**
- **Recommendations**: 15 compute instances flagged for downsizing.
- **Examples**:
  - `i-10005`: Change from `m5.xlarge` to `m5.large` → saves $90.00
  - `i-10013`: Change from `r5.2xlarge` to `r5.2large` → saves $200.00
- **Confidence**: 0.5 for all (fallback heuristic logic)

 **Insight**: All instances had low CPU utilization (<30%), making them ideal for safe downscaling. High total savings due to significant over-provisioning across the fleet.

##  2. Mixed Workload Scenario

- **Total Savings**: **$15.00** (net)
- **Recommendations**:  
  - 6 instances suggested for downsizing → ~$433 in savings  
  - 5 instances suggested for upsizing → ~$418 in added cost  
- **Net Effect**: Slight savings but improved performance posture
- **Examples**:
  - Downsize `i-30012` from `c5.2xlarge` → saves $170.00
  - Upsize `i-30013` to `r5.2xlarge` → costs $200.00
- **Confidence**: 0.5

 **Insight**: The agent balanced savings with performance, opting to upsize heavily loaded instances while trimming waste elsewhere.

##  3. Under-Provisioned Scenario

- **Total Savings**: **-$417.50** (i.e., increased cost)
- **Recommendations**:
  - 5 instances marked for upsizing due to high CPU usage
  - Additional cost: necessary to avoid performance degradation
- **Examples**:
  - `i-30013`: Change to `r5.2xlarge` → +$200.00
  - `i-30009`: Change to `r5.2xlarge` → +$100.00

**Insight**: Though the agent incurs additional cloud spend, it aligns with performance goals and workload demand — critical for under-provisioned production systems.

## Overall Impact Summary

| Scenario           | Instances Resized | Downsize Savings | Upsize Cost | Net Savings |
|--------------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Over-Provisioned   | 15 (all downsize) | $1210.00         | $0.00       | **$1210.00** |
| Mixed Workload     | 11 (6 down, 5 up) | $432.50          | -$417.50    | **$15.00**   |
| Under-Provisioned  | 5 (all upsize)    | $0.00            | -$417.50    | **-417.50**  |
